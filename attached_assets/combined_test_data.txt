- operational security (opsec)
- zero-knowledge proof systems
- threat model analysis
- tails os methodology
- warrant canary monitoring

## Conference Schedule
Next month, I'll be presenting at the International Cybersecurity Conference in London. My talk is titled "Detecting Digital Footprints: Advanced OSINT Techniques for Security Researchers." 

My colleague Dr. Emily Chen (Head of AI Security) will also be presenting her research on adversarial machine learning attacks.

If you'd like to connect at the conference, please reach out to my personal assistant Maria at maria.rodriguez@example.com.

## Current Research Focus
Currently, I'm investigating how dark web marketplaces have evolved following recent law enforcement operations. My team has been tracking changes in:
- Vendor migration patterns
- Trust mechanisms
- Escrow systems
- Identity verification methods
- Anonymity-enhancing technologies

Based on our preliminary findings, marketplaces are increasingly implementing advanced security measures including multi-signature transactions and distributed hosting infrastructure.

Lastly, if you're interested in joining our research team, please note that candidates must have a strong background in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and preferably a Master's degree or higher in a relevant field.
